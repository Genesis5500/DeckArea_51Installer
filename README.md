**Video Based Instructions are on Youtube below**

**For Text Based Instructions Continue Below**

**What you have to do:**
1. Enter desktop mode
2. Open Konsole and run the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genesis5500/DeckArea_51Installer.git
cd DeckArea_51Installer
chmod +x main
./main
```


**When the script finishes**
1. Go back to Gaming Mode and find the Area 51 non-Steam shortcut added
2. Set the proton version the script installed by going to the cog button on the right side of the entry > properties > turn on compatability > enable Proton 9.2
3. Start Game
4. Once started, go to controller configurations and community layout
5. Set configuration at A51 from community layouts

**What this script does:**
1. Checks for Area 51 (Project Dreamland Mod) files and needed Proton version
2. Installs Proton to correct Steam folder
3. Downloads and extracts to HOME
4. Sets Steam shortcut for application

**Things to Note**
1. Controls are a bit wonky because of this being a PC port
2. I tried my best to map them but one funky change is that in the main-menu the "Start" button is the back button

**Huge Shoutout to Project Dreamland and the creators of Lutris for making this possible!**
